Preventing misuse requires a combination of technical safeguards like circuit breakers and unlearning, access controls like monitored APIs and potentially KYC for compute, and careful consideration of release strategies, particularly regarding open-source models. Ensuring AGI safety involves pursuing alignment\u2014attempting to instill the right goals\u2014while simultaneously developing control mechanisms to mitigate harm even if alignment fails. This relies heavily on improving our ability to evaluate AI behavior and understand internal model workings, facing challenges like potential deception and the fragility of transparency.

Effective AI governance, encompassing international agreements on red lines or conditional commitments, alongside national regulations and compute oversight, is crucial.

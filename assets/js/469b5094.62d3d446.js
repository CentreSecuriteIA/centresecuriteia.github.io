More concerning, researchers have found that making systems robust against one type of attack can sometimes make them more vulnerable to others (",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15042",children:"Zhao et al., 2024"}),"). This suggests we may face fundamental trade-offs between different types of robustness and performance. There might even be potential fundamental limitations to how much we can mitigate these issues if we continue with the current training paradigms that we talked about in the capabilities chapter (",(0,n.jsx)(a,{term:"pre-training",definition:'{"definition":"The initial training phase where a model learns general representations from a large dataset before being adapted to specific tasks.","source":"","aliases":["Pre-training","pretraining"]}',children:(0,n.jsx)(a,{term:"pre-training",definition:'{"definition":"The initial training phase where a model learns general representations from a large dataset before being adapted to specific tasks.","source":"","aliases":["Pre-training","pretraining"]}',children:"pre-training"})})," followed by instruction tuning) (",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15230",children:"Bansal et al., 2022"}),")."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(t.strong,{children:["Despite efforts to make language models safer through alignment training, they remain susceptible to a wide range of attacks (",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10844",children:"Shayegani et al., 2023"}),")."]})," We want AI systems to learn from broad datasets to be more capable, but this increases privacy risks.

Attackers can inject malicious content through one modality (like images) to affect behavior in another modality (like text generation). For example, attackers can embed adversarial patterns in images that trigger harmful text generation, even when the text prompts themselves are completely safe (",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05451",children:"Chen et al., 2024)"}),".

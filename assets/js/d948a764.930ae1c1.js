Overly broad restrictions could hinder beneficial innovation. Additionally, once models are trained, they can often be run for inference using much less compute than training required. This makes it challenging to control how existing models are used without imposing overly restrictive controls on general computing infrastructure (",(0,s.jsx)(a.a,{href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08797",children:"Sastry et al., 2024"}),")."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(a.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(a.strong,{children:"Distributed training and inference approaches could bypass compute governance controls."})," Currently, training frontier models requires concentrating massive compute resources in single locations due to communication requirements between chips.

However, if we see fundamental advances in distributed training algorithms this could eventually allow training to be split across multiple smaller facilities.
